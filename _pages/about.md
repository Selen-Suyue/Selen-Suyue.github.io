I am a junior in the School of Artificial Intelligence at [Xidian University](https://www.xidian.edu.cn/), currently pursuing research in robot learning with a focus on visual perception and object affordance under the guidance of [Prof. Lixin Yang](https://lixiny.github.io/) and [Prof. Cewu Lu](https://www.mvig.org/index.html) at the [MVIG Lab](https://www.mvig.org/index.html), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). My ultimate goal is to create robots capable of autonomous exploration and learning through interaction with the environment.  

Previously, during my sophomore year, I contributed to research on adversarial attacks against computer vision systems at the [Key Laboratory of Cooperative Intelligent Systems, Ministry of Education](https://cois.xidian.edu.cn/index.htm), under the supervision of [Prof. Hao Li](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/haoli/) and [Prof. Maoguo Gong](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/mggong/). This experience instilled in me a deep appreciation for the importance of robustness and security in vision-based systems, particularly for applications in agents' autonomous exploration.

        <strong>Adversarial Attacks on 3D Vision Models</strong><br>
       Existing 3D adversarial attacks primarily manipulate point cloud geometry through object addition, posing practical deployment challenges. We introduce FGSM-based attacks directly perturbing point cloud geometry, demonstrating effectiveness against models like PointNet++. Our findings highlight the vulnerability of 3D models to geometric attacks and emphasize the role of sampling rules in their robustness.&#x1F680;<br>

        <strong>Adversarial Attacks on Multimodal Image Matching</strong><br>
        We propose Edge-Attack, a physical adversarial attack that probes VI-ReID models' ability to excavate deep-level feature spaces by perturbing modality-invariant shallow-level features. By generating realistic adversarial patches, we test models' robustness in leveraging deep-level implicit features. Edge-Attack exposes the vulnerability of sota VI-ReID models, highlighting the need for more robust feature extraction. <i>This work has been submitted to AAAI2025.</i> &#x1F680;<br>

        <strong>Infrared adversarial attacks on pedestrian detection</strong><br>
       In the past, real-world infrared adversarial attacks were one-off attacks and difficult to deploy. We used TEC to implement efficient infrared adversarial attacks that can adapt to scenarios in hardware. It can induce pedestrian detection models in infrared scenarios to make misjudgments. <i>This work has been submitted to AAAI2025.</i> &#x1F680;

Miscellaneous
---------------
Badminton is my guilty pleasure! Looking for someone to keep my skills sharp on campus.  Let's hit the court and work up a sweat! 

By the way, I'm also a bit of a debate nerd - took home the freshman championship at Xidian. 

And if we ever get tired of all that athleticism, I'm a huge fan of classic Chinese literature. Reading used to be my thing, but life has a way of making you forget your passions.  Maybe we can rediscover them together!
